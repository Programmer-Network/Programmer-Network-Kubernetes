## Introduction & Theoretical Foundations
### Tasks

#### [1. What is Kubernetes? ðŸŽ¥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlHvYWVUZyc&ab_channel=ByteByteGo)
- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Kubernetes Components Explained

### Control Plane Components

- **API Server**: 
  - Acts as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane.

- **etcd**: 
  - Consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

- **Scheduler**: 
  - Responsible for scheduling pods onto nodes.

- **Controller Manager**: 
  - Runs controllers, which are background threads that handle routine tasks in the cluster.

### Worker Node Components

- **Worker Node**: 
  - Machines, VMs, or physical computers that run your applications.

- **Pods**: 
  - The smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes.

- **kubelet**: 
  - An agent that runs on each worker node in the cluster and ensures that containers are running in a pod.

- **kube-proxy**: 
  - Maintains network rules on nodes, allowing network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.



#### 2. Why Use Kubernetes?
- **Scaling**: Easily scale applications up or down as needed.
- **High Availability**: Ensure that your applications are fault-tolerant and highly available.
- **Portability**: Move workloads across different cloud providers or on-premises environments.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Describe what you want, and Kubernetes makes it happen.

#### 3. Core Components and Concepts
- **Control Plane**: The set of components that manage the overall state of the cluster.
- **Nodes**: The worker machines that run containers.
- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units that can contain one or more containers.
- **Services**: A way to expose Pods to the network.
- **Ingress**: Manages external access to services within a cluster.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Manage configuration data and secrets separately from container images.

#### 4. Architecture Overview
- **Bottom-Up View**: Understand Kubernetes from the infrastructure (Nodes) to Pods, to Services, and upwards.
- **Top-Down View**: Start from the user's perspective, breaking down what you want to deploy into services, pods, and the underlying infrastructure.

#### 5. Read and Research
- Go through Kubernetes' official documentation.
- Watch beginner-friendly YouTube tutorials or online courses.

#### 6. Community and Ecosystem
- Get familiar with the wider Kubernetes ecosystem, including tooling, forums, and meetups.

# Setup

## Raspberry Pi
### Tasks


#### 1. Flash SD Cards with Raspberry Pi OS Using Pi Imager
- Open [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
  - Choose the 'OS' you want to install from the list. The tool will download the selected OS image for you.
  - Insert your SD card and select it in the 'Storage' section.
  - Before writing, click on the cog icon for advanced settings.
    - Set the hostname to your desired value, e.g., `RP1`.
    - Enable SSH and select the "allow public-key authorization only" option.
  - Click on 'Write' to begin the flashing process.
  
#### 2. Initial Boot and Setup
- Insert the flashed SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on.
- On the first boot, follow the on-screen setup steps if using a UI, or ssh into the Pi to perform initial configuration.
  
#### 3. Update and Upgrade
- Run the following commands to update the package list and upgrade the installed packages:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade

#### 4. Assign Static IP Addresses

After SSHing into your Raspberry Pi, you can configure static IP by editing the `dhcpcd.conf` file:


```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

Add the following, adapting to your network configuration:

```
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.XX/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1
```

* static `ip_address`: The static IP you want to assign to the Raspberry Pi.
* static `router`: The IP address of the default gateway (usually your router).
* static `domain_name_servers`: The IP address of the DNS server (can be the same as the gateway).

Save the file and exit, then restart the networking service:

```bash
sudo service dhcpcd restart
```



## Retrieve IP and MAC Address of Raspberry Pi via SSH

Retrieving both the IP and MAC addresses of each Raspberry Pi unit is essential for setting up your network configurations. You will need both of these for DHCP reservations in the Mikrotik router to ensure that each unit always receives the same IP address upon booting up.

SSH into your Raspberry Pi and run the following command:

```bash
ip addr show eth0 | awk '/inet / {print "IP: " $2} /ether/ {print "MAC: " $2}'
```

- `ip addr show eth0`: This command retrieves the network configuration for the `eth0` interface.
  - `ip`: This is the command to show and manipulate routing, devices, and tunnels.
  - `addr`: Specifies that we're interested in the IP addresses associated with network interfaces.
  - `show eth0`: Specifies that we only want information related to the `eth0` interface.
  
- `|`: The pipe command takes the output of the command on its left (`ip addr show eth0`) and uses it as input for the command on its right (the `awk` command).

- `awk '/inet / {print "IP: " $2} /ether/ {print "MAC: " $2}'`: This is an `awk` command that processes the input line-by-line.
  - `/inet /`: This regular expression matches lines that contain the string "inet", which typically signifies the line with the IP address.
    - `{print "IP: " $2}`: When a line matches, `awk` prints "IP: " followed by the second field (`$2`) on the line, which is usually the IP address.
  - `/ether/`: This regular expression matches lines that contain the string "ether", which is where the MAC address is usually found.
    - `{print "MAC: " $2}`: When a line matches, `awk` prints "MAC: " followed by the second field on the line, which is usually the MAC address.

Putting it all together, this command fetches the network information of `eth0`, pipes it into `awk`, which then extracts and prints out the IP and MAC addresses.

This will display the IP address on one line and the MAC address on another. Take note of these details, as you will be using them to configure static IPs and DHCP reservations in the Mikrotik router in the upcoming steps.

## Configuring MikroTik Router for Static IPs

### DHCP Reservations

1. **Navigate to DHCP Server settings**: Open the MikroTik interface and go to `IP > DHCP Server > Leases`.
2. **Add New Lease**: Click on the `Add New` or `+` button.
3. **Set Lease Details**: Fill in the `MAC Address` and `IP Address` fields.
4. **Apply & Confirm**: Click on `Apply` and `OK`.

### Using Address List (Optional)

1. **Go to Address List**: Navigate to `IP > Firewall > Address Lists`.
2. **Add New Entry**: Click `Add New` or `+`.
3. **Specify Details**: Add the `IP Address` and set a `List` name.
4. **Apply & Confirm**: Click `Apply` and `OK`.


## SSH Aliases for Raspberry Pi Cluster

Once you have assigned static IPs to your Raspberry Pis, you can simplify the SSH process by setting up SSH aliases. Here's how to do it:

1. **Open the SSH config file on your local machine:**

    ```bash
    vi ~/.ssh/config
    ```
    
2. **Add the following entries for each Raspberry Pi:**

    ```plaintext
    Host rp1
      HostName <Master_IP>
      User YOUR_USERNAME

    Host rp2
      HostName <Worker1_IP>
      User YOUR_USERNAME

    Host rpi-worker2
      HostName <Worker2_IP>
      User YOUR_USERNAME

    Host rpi-worker3
      HostName <Worker3_IP>
      User YOUR_USERNAME
    ```
    
    Replace `<Master_IP>`, `<Worker1_IP>`, `<Worker2_IP>`, and `<Worker3_IP>` with the actual static IP addresses of your Raspberry Pis.

3. **Save and Close the File**

4. **Apply Configurations**

    ```bash
    ssh-add -R rpi-master
    ```

    This removes all keys belonging to `rpi-master` from the known hosts files. Repeat for other aliases as needed. 

5. **Test Your Aliases**

    You should now be able to SSH into each Raspberry Pi using the alias:

    ```bash
    ssh rpi-master
    ```

That's it! You've set up SSH aliases for your Raspberry Pi cluster.


## Router
### Tasks

#### 1. Assign Static IPs on MikroTik Router
- Open the MikroTik Web UI and navigate to `IP > DHCP Server`.
- Locate the `Leases` tab and identify the MAC addresses of your Raspberry Pi units.
- Click on the entry for each Raspberry Pi and change it from "dynamic" to "static".
- Assign a static IP address that is within your local network range but outside of the DHCP pool.

#### 2. Enable Port Forwarding for Master Node (Optional)
- If you plan to access the Kubernetes API server from outside your network, you'll need to set up port forwarding.
- Navigate to `IP > Firewall > NAT`.
- Add a new rule to forward the external port (e.g., 6443) to the internal IP and port of your master node.

#### 3. Configure Firewall Rules
- To add an extra layer of security, explicitly allow only the necessary ports between nodes.
- Navigate to `IP > Firewall > Filter Rules`.
- Add rules to allow traffic only on the ports that Kubernetes and your applications will use.

#### 4. VLAN Configuration (Advanced, Optional)
- If you want to segregate your Kubernetes traffic from other network traffic, consider setting up a VLAN.
- Navigate to `Interfaces > VLAN` and configure as needed.

#### 5. DNS Configuration
- If you plan to use domain names to access services in your cluster, add the DNS records in the MikroTik router.
- Navigate to `IP > DNS` and add static DNS entries if needed.

#### 6. Update Router Firmware
- To ensure that you are running the most stable and secure version of RouterOS, check for firmware updates.
- Navigate to `System > Packages` and update if necessary.

#### 7. Backup Router Configuration
- Once all configurations are complete and tested, backup the router configuration.
- Navigate to `Files` and create a backup.

## Integrating Cloudflare Tunnel with K3S Kubernetes Cluster

### Prerequisites

- A K3S Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- A Cloudflare account and a domain managed by Cloudflare.

### Steps

#### 1. Install `cloudflared` on a Node

Install Cloudflare's `cloudflared` software on one of your Raspberry Pis. Here, we assume the master node for simplicity.

```bash
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/download/.../cloudflared-linux-arm
chmod +x cloudflared-linux-arm
sudo mv cloudflared-linux-arm /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
```

#### 2. Authenticate cloudflared

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the authentication.

#### 3. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel

Create a new tunnel with your desired name.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create <tunnel_name>
```

#### 4. Configure the Tunnel

Edit the `cloudflared` configuration file to route traffic from the tunnel to your K3S Ingress controller. The configuration might look like the following:

```yaml
tunnel: <tunnel_id>
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<tunnel_id>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: your.domain.com
    service: http://localhost:80  # Point this to your Ingress Controller
  - service: http_status:404
```

#### 5. Run the Tunnel

Start the Cloudflare tunnel.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel run <tunnel_name>
```

#### 6. Configure Cloudflare DNS

Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and configure the DNS settings to point to the newly created tunnel.

#### 7. Kubernetes Ingress Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: your.domain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80

```


## Cluster Setup

### Master Node

#### Tasks

1. **Choose a Master Node**: Select one Raspberry Pi to act as the master node.
2. **Install K3s**: Use the following command to install K3s on the master node.

    ```bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
    ```

3. **Verify Cluster**: Ensure that `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` was created and the cluster is accessible.

    ```bash
    kubectl --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml get nodes
    ```

### Worker Nodes

#### Tasks

##### Ansible Automation for Cluster Setup

Automating the setup of multiple Raspberry Pis can save time and ensure consistency. We'll use Ansible for this purpose.

###### Pre-requisites


#### Initial Minimal SSH Setup on Master Node

1. **Enable SSH on the master Raspberry Pi if not already enabled:**

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
Navigate to `Interface Options > SSH` and enable it.

#### Ansible Installation on Master Node

1. **Update the package list and install prerequisites:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common

sudo apt install ansible
```

3. **Verify Ansible installation:**
```bash
ansible --version
```

#### Optionally, Install `sshpass` for Initial SSH Authentication

1. **Install `sshpass`:**
```bash
sudo apt install sshpass
```

> **Note**: Detailed SSH setup, including copying public keys for password-less login, will be automated through Ansible.


###### Steps

1. **Generate an SSH Key on Master Node (Optional)**: This key can be used for password-less login to all worker nodes.

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```

2. **Copy the Public Key to All Nodes (Optional)**: Replace `<worker_node_ip>` with the IP of each worker node.

    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id pi@<worker_node_ip>
    ```

3. **Create an Ansible Inventory File**: Create a `hosts.ini` file and populate it with your node details.

    ```ini
    [master]
    master ansible_host=<master_node_ip> ansible_user=pi

    [workers]
    worker1 ansible_host=<worker1_node_ip> ansible_user=pi
    worker2 ansible_host=<worker2_node_ip> ansible_user=pi
    ```

4. **Retrieve the K3s Join Token from Master Node**: Copy the token for use in the Ansible playbook.

    ```bash
    cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/token
    ```

5. **Create an Ansible Playbook for Worker Node Setup**: Create a `setup-workers.yml` file.

    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Setup K3s Workers
      hosts: workers
      become: yes
      vars:
        k3s_token: "<your_k3s_token_here>"
        k3s_master: "<master_node_ip_here>"
      tasks:
      - name: Join worker to K3s cluster
        shell: |
          curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://{{ k3s_master }}:6443 K3S_TOKEN={{ k3s_token }} sh -
    ```

6. **Run the Ansible Playbook**: Execute the playbook to join all worker nodes to the master node.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini setup-workers.yml
    ```

7. **Verify Cluster**: Run the following command to make sure all nodes have joined the cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

## Basic Deployments

### Tasks

Create a new Kubernetes namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace my-apps
```

Deploy a simple "Hello World" app or web server like Nginx:

```bash
kubectl run hello-world --image=nginx --port=80 --namespace=my-apps
```

Expose the deployment as a ClusterIP service:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=ClusterIP --port=80 --namespace=my-apps
```
Verify the deployment using `port-forward`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/hello-world 8080:80 --namespace=my-apps
```
