## Introduction & Theoretical Foundations
### Tasks

#### [1. What is Kubernetes? ðŸŽ¥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlHvYWVUZyc&ab_channel=ByteByteGo)
- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Kubernetes Components Explained

### Control Plane Components

- **API Server**: 
  - Acts as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane.

- **etcd**: 
  - Consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

- **Scheduler**: 
  - Responsible for scheduling pods onto nodes.

- **Controller Manager**: 
  - Runs controllers, which are background threads that handle routine tasks in the cluster.

### Worker Node Components

- **Worker Node**: 
  - Machines, VMs, or physical computers that run your applications.

- **Pods**: 
  - The smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes.

- **kubelet**: 
  - An agent that runs on each worker node in the cluster and ensures that containers are running in a pod.

- **kube-proxy**: 
  - Maintains network rules on nodes, allowing network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.



#### 2. Why Use Kubernetes?
- **Scaling**: Easily scale applications up or down as needed.
- **High Availability**: Ensure that your applications are fault-tolerant and highly available.
- **Portability**: Move workloads across different cloud providers or on-premises environments.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Describe what you want, and Kubernetes makes it happen.

#### 3. Core Components and Concepts
- **Control Plane**: The set of components that manage the overall state of the cluster.
- **Nodes**: The worker machines that run containers.
- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units that can contain one or more containers.
- **Services**: A way to expose Pods to the network.
- **Ingress**: Manages external access to services within a cluster.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Manage configuration data and secrets separately from container images.

#### 4. Architecture Overview
- **Bottom-Up View**: Understand Kubernetes from the infrastructure (Nodes) to Pods, to Services, and upwards.
- **Top-Down View**: Start from the user's perspective, breaking down what you want to deploy into services, pods, and the underlying infrastructure.

#### 5. Read and Research
- Go through Kubernetes' official documentation.
- Watch beginner-friendly YouTube tutorials or online courses.

#### 6. Community and Ecosystem
- Get familiar with the wider Kubernetes ecosystem, including tooling, forums, and meetups.

## Integrating Cloudflare Tunnel with K3S Kubernetes Cluster

### Overview

Using Cloudflare Tunnel with your K3S cluster allows you to expose your services to the internet securely. Cloudflare Tunnel routes your traffic through Cloudflare's global network, thereby adding an additional layer of security and network optimization.

### Prerequisites

- A K3S Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- A Cloudflare account and a domain managed by Cloudflare.

### Steps

#### 1. Install `cloudflared` on a Node

Install Cloudflare's `cloudflared` software on one of your Raspberry Pis. Here, we assume the master node for simplicity.

```bash
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/download/.../cloudflared-linux-arm
chmod +x cloudflared-linux-arm
sudo mv cloudflared-linux-arm /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
```

#### 2. Authenticate cloudflared

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the authentication.

#### 3. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel

Create a new tunnel with your desired name.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create <tunnel_name>
```

#### 4. Configure the Tunnel

Edit the `cloudflared` configuration file to route traffic from the tunnel to your K3S Ingress controller. The configuration might look like the following:

```yaml
tunnel: <tunnel_id>
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<tunnel_id>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: your.domain.com
    service: http://localhost:80  # Point this to your Ingress Controller
  - service: http_status:404
```

#### 5. Run the Tunnel

Start the Cloudflare tunnel.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel run <tunnel_name>
```

#### 6. Configure Cloudflare DNS

Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and configure the DNS settings to point to the newly created tunnel.

#### 7. Kubernetes Ingress Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: your.domain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80

```


## Cluster Setup

### Master Node

#### Tasks

1. **Choose a Master Node**: Select one Raspberry Pi to act as the master node.
2. **Install K3s**: Use the following command to install K3s on the master node.

    ```bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
    ```

3. **Verify Cluster**: Ensure that `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` was created and the cluster is accessible.

    ```bash
    kubectl --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml get nodes
    ```

### Worker Nodes

#### Tasks

##### Ansible Automation for Cluster Setup

Automating the setup of multiple Raspberry Pis can save time and ensure consistency. We'll use Ansible for this purpose.

###### Pre-requisites


#### Initial Minimal SSH Setup on Master Node

1. **Enable SSH on the master Raspberry Pi if not already enabled:**

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
Navigate to `Interface Options > SSH` and enable it.

#### Ansible Installation on Master Node

1. **Update the package list and install prerequisites:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
```

2. **Add the Ansible PPA and install Ansible:**
```bash
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible
```

3. **Verify Ansible installation:**
```bash
ansible --version
```

#### Optionally, Install `sshpass` for Initial SSH Authentication

1. **Install `sshpass`:**
```bash
sudo apt install sshpass
```

> **Note**: Detailed SSH setup, including copying public keys for password-less login, will be automated through Ansible.


###### Steps

1. **Generate an SSH Key on Master Node (Optional)**: This key can be used for password-less login to all worker nodes.

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```

2. **Copy the Public Key to All Nodes (Optional)**: Replace `<worker_node_ip>` with the IP of each worker node.

    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id pi@<worker_node_ip>
    ```

3. **Create an Ansible Inventory File**: Create a `hosts.ini` file and populate it with your node details.

    ```ini
    [master]
    master ansible_host=<master_node_ip> ansible_user=pi

    [workers]
    worker1 ansible_host=<worker1_node_ip> ansible_user=pi
    worker2 ansible_host=<worker2_node_ip> ansible_user=pi
    ```

4. **Retrieve the K3s Join Token from Master Node**: Copy the token for use in the Ansible playbook.

    ```bash
    cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/token
    ```

5. **Create an Ansible Playbook for Worker Node Setup**: Create a `setup-workers.yml` file.

    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Setup K3s Workers
      hosts: workers
      become: yes
      vars:
        k3s_token: "<your_k3s_token_here>"
        k3s_master: "<master_node_ip_here>"
      tasks:
      - name: Join worker to K3s cluster
        shell: |
          curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://{{ k3s_master }}:6443 K3S_TOKEN={{ k3s_token }} sh -
    ```

6. **Run the Ansible Playbook**: Execute the playbook to join all worker nodes to the master node.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini setup-workers.yml
    ```

7. **Verify Cluster**: Run the following command to make sure all nodes have joined the cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

## Basic Deployments

### Tasks

Create a new Kubernetes namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace my-apps
```

Deploy a simple "Hello World" app or web server like Nginx:

```bash
kubectl run hello-world --image=nginx --port=80 --namespace=my-apps
```

Expose the deployment as a ClusterIP service:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=ClusterIP --port=80 --namespace=my-apps
```
Verify the deployment using `port-forward`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/hello-world 8080:80 --namespace=my-apps
```
