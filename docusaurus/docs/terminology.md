title: Terminology

This course covers much more than Kubernetes, touching on storage, networking, security, and many other topics. To fully understand the material, it's important to learn a wide range of concepts. While this might seem challenging, it also makes the process satisfying and rewarding.

In my experience as a teacher and professional, a common mistake people make when learning is not taking the time to pause and understand new terms or concepts. Instead, they rush ahead, which can weaken their foundation and make it harder to build a deep understanding later.

As you go through this course, give yourself the time and patience to pause whenever you come across a new protocol or term. At the very least, take a moment to understand it on a basic level so you can confidently move forward.

In today’s world, it’s easy to copy and paste solutions, especially with tools like AI. However, this can lead us to skip the important step of going back to understand the basics.
