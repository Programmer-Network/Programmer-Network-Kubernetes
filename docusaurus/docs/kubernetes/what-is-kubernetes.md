title: What is Kubernetes? ðŸŽ¥
---

As with anything in life, my experience has taught me that focusing on the essence of something and then going top-down is the best way to learn. In the context of Kubernetes, this means understanding it in a "_teach me like I'm 6 years old_" way. Kubernetes is a complex system, and trying to understand every component of it at the very beginning is overwhelming, and it will only lead to frustration. Additionally, it won't be useful anyway, as this theory becomes important later in time, once things start failing (not working) and you need to debug.

So, what I need you to get out of this section is the main benefit of an orchestration platform like Kubernetes, what it does, and how it can help us engineers.

Before you jump onto any of the resources below, I have to emphasize that the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) is by far the best resource.

### Kubernetes Components Explained

#### Control Plane Components

- **API Server**:

  - Acts as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane.

- **[etcd](https://etcd.io/)**:

  - Consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

- **Scheduler**:

  - Responsible for scheduling pods onto nodes.

- **Controller Manager**:
  - Runs controllers, which are background threads that handle routine tasks in the cluster.

#### Worker Node Components

- **Worker Node**:

  - Machines, VMs, or physical computers that run your applications.

- **Pods**:

  - The smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes.

- **kubelet**:

  - An agent that runs on each worker node in the cluster and ensures that containers are running in a pod.

- **kube-proxy**:
  - Maintains network rules on nodes, allowing network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.

#### 2. Why Use Kubernetes?

- **Scaling**: Easily scale applications up or down as needed.
- **High Availability**: Ensure that your applications are fault-tolerant and highly available.
- **Portability**: Move workloads across different cloud providers or on-premises environments.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Describe what you want, and Kubernetes makes it happen.

#### 3. Core Components and Concepts

- **Control Plane**: The set of components that manage the overall state of the cluster.
- **Nodes**: The worker machines that run containers.
- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units that can contain one or more containers.
- **Services**: A way to expose Pods to the network.
- **Ingress**: Manages external access to services within a cluster.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Manage configuration data and secrets separately from container images.

#### 4. Architecture Overview

- **Bottom-Up View**: Understand Kubernetes from the infrastructure (Nodes) to Pods, to Services, and upwards.
- **Top-Down View**: Start from the user's perspective, breaking down what you want to deploy into services, pods, and the underlying infrastructure.

#### 5. Read and Research

- Go through [Kubernetes' official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).
- Watch [beginner-friendly YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6WC5n9G_sM&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) or online courses.

#### 6. Community and Ecosystem

- Get familiar with the wider Kubernetes ecosystem, including tooling, forums, and meetups.
