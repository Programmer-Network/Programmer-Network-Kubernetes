  description="The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few and the principle of factor 
  sparsity) states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes."

In our case of Kubernetes, that means that by focusing also upfront to a potential issues that we might face, we can save a
lot of time by being aware of these very issues, and how to best debug them.
