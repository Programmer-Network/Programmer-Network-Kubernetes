With access to nearly unlimited information today, you have to ask yourself, **"Why the heck am I learning this?"**

Why would I choose this when there are 18 billion other things I can learn right now? How will this skill help me in my career? Will it solve any problems I experience daily? Do I even experience these problems? These are exactly the kinds of questions you should be asking, and more importantly, make sure you truly have answers to these questions before you embark on a journey like this.

Many of you know me from [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/programmer_network) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@programmer-network), I’m a realist, and I can’t stand bullshit. I dislike influencers because they often talk about things just to fit their content agenda, rather than having real knowledge of the subject, let alone using the solutions they promote to solve their own problems.

So, the question **“Why should I learn Kubernetes?”** is absolutely one you should ask yourself—regardless of what I write in the next paragraph. I might give you no reason, or I might give you 15, but maybe none of them will be relevant to you at this moment. Maybe there are other skills that would benefit you more right now—whether it’s landing your first job or advancing your current career. There’s a big difference between things that are "cool to play with" and things that are actually "nice to have" in your skillset. We each have unique needs at specific points in time, so I’d urge you to seriously consider whether learning Kubernetes is what you truly need **right now**.
