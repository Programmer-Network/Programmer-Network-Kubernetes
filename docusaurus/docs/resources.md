title: Resources

I've been in this industry for over 20 years, and I can with certainty say that there's no better community than the one in this industry. Everytyhing that we build, all the new things we come up with, are the combination of the work of many people. In simple terms, we are all sharing knowledge with each other, and building up on top of each other's work.

This very guide is no exception of that. I came up with many ideas, but also, got inspired by the work of others.

While I haven't been using the things from these resources directly, e.g. some might have only challenged me to think differently, I'll still share them for the sake of being transparent, aka, being a good citizen of the community.

The order is random, and I'll write them down as I go through my notes.
