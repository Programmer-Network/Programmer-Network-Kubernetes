title: Why?
---

Answering this question honestly, for each of us individually, is fundamental because it will determine the outcome and likelihood of success or failure. If you're learning something just because you heard about it from the latest content creator, or because "everyone seems to be using it," you’re already off to a poor start. 

What I’ve learned over the last two decades of my career is that if you’re wondering whether you need something, you probably don’t. These things usually come naturally as a result of the problems you encounter. The problem itself often guides you to the right tools, just like this one.

Rather than getting too deep into philosophy, I’ll share my personal reasons for learning Kubernetes, and more generally, hosting a bare-metal server:

### Personal Reasons

#### End-to-End Product Knowledge  

As my career moves towards a CTO role, having **end-to-end** knowledge of as many components of a product as possible is essential. Understanding the technology stack inside out will enable me to make better decisions and interface more effectively with stakeholders, investors, and engineering teams.

#### Efficient Infrastructure Provisioning  

I want to be able to provision infrastructure in under 5 minutes while thinking as little about it as possible. My focus should be on building products, not managing infrastructure. Additionally, the infrastructure needs to remain **cost-efficient**. Right now, I’m paying **24 euros a month** for Hetzner, which equals **about 300 euros a year**. Within two years, the hardware for my own cluster (which I’ve already paid for upfront) will have effectively paid for itself through the savings.

#### Expanding My Skill Set for Work  

My company is a **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) partner**, and we already use Kubernetes. By mastering Kubernetes, I’ll add an extra skill to my professional toolkit and be better positioned to help my company with Kubernetes-related projects.

#### Migrating My Platform  

I plan to move my [**Programmer Network**](https://programmer.network) platform from Hetzner to my own bare-metal K3S cluster, reducing costs and gaining greater control over the infrastructure.

#### Keeping My Skills Sharp  

Maintaining a bare-metal server forces me to regularly **maintain** it, which helps me retain and sharpen the technical skills I’ve developed over time but might not frequently use in my day-to-day work. By continuing to use these skills, I ensure they remain active and relevant.

#### I see the future of infrastructure leaning towards bare metal

As hardware becomes more efficient and cheaper to acquire, I predict that the future of infrastructure won't be `cloud-only` as it may seem now. While cloud solutions like GCP, AWS, and Azure are incredibly powerful, they come with high costs (even though they often save your engineers time) and may raise privacy concerns for some companies. As fiber-optic internet becomes more globally accessible and hardware costs continue to decrease, I believe that more companies will be confident enough to shift back to hosting on their own infrastructure—especially since technologies like Kubernetes make it significantly easier to manage and scale.

### What Are Yours?

You now know my reasons for wanting to learn Kubernetes. Now, it’s essential for you to either find yourself in some of these points, or come up with solid reasons of your own. I highly suggest having an internal discussion with yourself to figure out whether there's value for you in learning Kubernetes. 

Learning new things should never be something we question; we should always strive to learn. The real question is: *Should I spend a few months learning Kubernetes*, or would my time be better spent learning another skill that will provide immediate value?
