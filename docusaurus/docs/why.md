title: Why Build a Home Mini Data Center?
---

Answering this question honestly, for each of us individually, is fundamental
because it will determine the outcome and likelihood of success or failure. If
you're building something just because you heard about it from the latest
content creator, or because "everyone seems to be doing it," you're already off
to a poor start.

What I've learned over the last two decades of my career is that if you're
wondering whether you need something, you probably don't. These things usually
come naturally as a result of the problems you encounter. The problem itself
often guides you to the right tools, just like this one.

Rather than getting too deep into philosophy, I'll share my personal reasons for
building a complete mini data center at home - from setting up the physical rack
and hardware (Raspberry Pis and Mini PCs), to configuring MikroTik networking
equipment, and deploying Kubernetes:

### End-to-End Infrastructure Knowledge

As my career moves towards a CTO role, having **end-to-end** knowledge of
infrastructure is essential - from physical hardware and networking to container
orchestration and application deployment. Understanding the complete technology
stack inside out will enable me to make better decisions and interface more
effectively with stakeholders, investors, and engineering teams.

### Efficient Infrastructure Provisioning

I want to be able to provision infrastructure in under 5 minutes while thinking
as little about it as possible. My focus should be on building products, not
managing infrastructure. Additionally, the infrastructure needs to remain
**cost-efficient**. Right now, I'm paying **24 euros a month** for Hetzner,
which equals **about 300 euros a year**. Within two years, the hardware for my
own mini data center (which I've already paid for upfront) will have effectively
paid for itself through the savings.

### Complete Control Over the Stack

Building a mini data center gives me full control over every aspect of my
infrastructure:

- **Hardware**: Choice of Raspberry Pis and Mini PCs for different workloads
- **Networking**: Custom MikroTik setup for advanced networking capabilities
- **Storage**: Dedicated storage solutions
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (K3s) for container management
- **Security**: End-to-end control over security measures

### Keeping My Skills Sharp

Maintaining a complete data center forces me to regularly **maintain** and
upgrade various components - from hardware and networking to software and
orchestration. This helps me retain and sharpen the technical skills I've
developed over time but might not frequently use in my day-to-day work. By
continuing to use these skills, I ensure they remain active and relevant.

### I see the future of infrastructure leaning towards on-premises

As hardware becomes more efficient and cheaper to acquire, I predict that the
future of infrastructure won't be `cloud-only` as it may seem now. While cloud
solutions like GCP, AWS, and Azure are incredibly powerful, they come with high
costs (even though they often save your engineers time) and may raise privacy
concerns for some companies. As fiber-optic internet becomes more globally
accessible and hardware costs continue to decrease, I believe that more
companies will be confident enough to shift back to hosting on their own
infrastructure, especially since modern tools make it significantly easier to
manage and scale.

### What Are Your Reasons?

You now know my reasons for building a complete mini data center at home. It's
essential for you to either find yourself in some of these points or come up
with solid reasons of your own. I highly suggest having an internal discussion
with yourself to figure out whether there's value for you in undertaking this
journey.

Learning new things should never be something we question; we should always
strive to learn. The real question is: _Should I invest time in building and
maintaining a mini data center_, or would my time be better spent learning
another skill that will provide immediate value?
