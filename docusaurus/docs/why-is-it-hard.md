title: The reason why it's hard
---

One of the hardest things about learning something like Kubernetes isn't the subject itself. Many developers often find themselves learning things without a clear reason or a goal. And while that is bad, it's not the worst thing.

The worst thing is learning something and then forgetting that it exists. In the context of our "mini home data-center", if you end up going through this guide and then just abandoning your setup, you will find yourself forgetting most of these things really, really fast. The advantage that I believe this entire guide enforces is that we are actually building an infrastructure that we intend to use. It's our mini data-center that we are happy to maintain, all the way from the L2 networking layer to an API and a frontend.

Clearly, you can also look at this as a massive disadvantage, and to answer that question, we really need to get back to [why](./why.md) and understand what we are getting out of this journey.

So, to make this learning experience easy for oneself, we need to ensure that:

- We are building this as our infrastructure that we will use
- We understand that building a bare-metal infrastructure requires some maintenance, and that is what we are looking forward to
- We are absolutely certain that at one point, something will fail, either hardware or software, and we are looking forward to that lesson, a moment of experience
- We look at this setup as a massive advantage for learning and growing, and for keeping our skills sharp
- We understand that diversifying our skills, especially in the age of AI, helps us stay relevant and pivot in the job market
