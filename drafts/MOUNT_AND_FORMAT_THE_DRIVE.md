To **reformat and recreate a partition** (in your case, **`sda1`**) using **`fdisk`** on Linux, you can follow the steps outlined below. These instructions will guide you through deleting the existing partition, creating a new one, and then formatting it properly.

Since you're working with an external device and the partition appears to be large (**931.5GB**), I assume it's an external hard drive or SSD attached via USB.

### ⚠️ **Important!** Before proceeding:
1. **Backup Data**: Formatting and deleting the partition will erase all data on it, so ensure you have backed up any important data currently stored on **`sda1`**.
2. **Unmount the Partition**: If the partition is currently mounted, you’ll need to unmount it before working on it.

### Steps to Format and Recreate **`sda1`** Using `fdisk`:

#### **1. Unmount the Partition**
Before modifying the partition, unmount it if it's mounted:
```bash
sudo umount /dev/sda1
```

#### **2. Launch `fdisk` to Edit the Partition Table**
Run `fdisk` for the target device (`/dev/sda` in your case):
```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

This will start the interactive **`fdisk`** utility on the entire **`/dev/sda`** disk.

#### **3. Delete the Existing Partition**
Once inside the `fdisk` tool, list the partitions to verify:
```bash
p
```

This should display your existing partition table, showing the **`sda1`** partition (`/dev/sda1`).

To delete the existing partition **`sda1`**:
1. Press `d` (to delete a partition).
2. If there is only one partition (`sda1`), it will automatically choose `1`. Otherwise, you may be asked to specify the partition number (enter `1` to select **`sda1`**).

Confirm that **`/dev/sda1`** has been deleted by pressing `p` again to view the partition table—it should now list no partitions.

#### **4. Create a New Partition**
Now, create a new partition by doing the following:

- Type `n` (to create a new partition).
  - When asked for the partition type, press `p` to create a **primary partition**.
  - When asked for the partition number, press `1` (to recreate it as **`sda1`**).
  - Choose the **default starting sector** by just pressing `Enter` (this will typically start at sector 2048 if you're using a GPT or MBR partition scheme).
  - You will be asked for the last sector — press `Enter` to choose the default and use the rest of the available space from the starting sector, effectively recreating a partition that spans the entire disk.

#### **5. Set the Partition's Filesystem (Optional)**
If you're partitioning for normal use (e.g., formatting to **ext4**), you can skip this step. But if you want to set a specific partition type (like Linux filesystem (`83`)), you'll be prompted to choose it. By default, **`fdisk`** will set it to **`83` (Linux Filesystem)** for most Linux machines.

To explicitly set it:
- Press `t` to change the partition type.
- Type `83` for Linux filesystem.

#### **6. Write the Partition Table**  
Once satisfied with the changes, write the new partition table to the disk by typing:
```bash
w
```

This will save the changes and exit `fdisk`.

### 7. Format the New Partition (**ext4**)

Now that **`sda1`** has been recreated, you will want to format it with a filesystem. In your case, I recommend **ext4** unless you have a specific reason to use another filesystem type.

To format **`/dev/sda1`** as **ext4**:
```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
```

This will begin formatting the newly created partition `sda1` as an **ext4** volume. The process will take some time, depending on the size of the partition.

---

### 8. Mount the New Partition & Check

Once the partition is formatted, you can mount it back for use:

1. Create a mount point (if it doesn’t exist yet):
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/mydisk
   ```

2. Mount the partition:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/mydisk
   ```

3. Verify the mount:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

You should now see the newly mounted **`sda1`** partition, and it should be available in **`/mnt/mydisk`**.

---

### 9. Add to `/etc/fstab` for Persistent Mounting (Optional)

If you want this disk to mount automatically at boot, add an entry to **`/etc/fstab`**:

1. Find the **UUID** of the partition:
   ```bash
   sudo blkid /dev/sda1
   ```

   You will see an output that looks something like this:
   ```bash
   /dev/sda1: UUID="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" TYPE="ext4"
   ```

2. Open `/etc/fstab` in an editor:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

3. Add the following line to the end of the file to make the partition auto-mount at `/mnt/mydisk` on boot:
   ```bash
   UUID=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx /mnt/mydisk ext4 defaults 0 0
   ```

4. Save (`Ctrl + O`) and exit (`Ctrl + X`).

---

### **Conclusion:**
You’ve now successfully reformatted and recreated **`sda1`** using `fdisk` and formatted it as **ext4**. This partition is mounted and ready to store data. By adding the entry to **`/etc/fstab`**, it will automatically mount on boot.
