### Hardware Components

The setup illustrated here is not mandatory but reflects my personal choices based on both experience and specific requirements. I aimed for a setup that is not only robust but also relatively mobile. Therefore, I opted for a 4U Rack where all the components are neatly encapsulated, making it easy to plug and play. I plan to expand this cluster by adding another four Raspberry Pis once the prices are more accommodating.

- **[Mikrotik RB3011UiAS-RM](https://mikrotik.com/product/RB3011UiAS-RM)**: I chose Mikrotik's router as it offers a professional-grade, feature-rich solution at an affordable price. This router allows for a myriad of configurations and functionalities that you'd typically find in higher-end solutions like Cisco. Its features like robust firewall options, VPN support, and advanced routing capabilities made it a compelling choice.

- **[4x Raspberry Pi 4 B 8GB](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)**: I opted for the 8GB variant of the Raspberry Pi 4 B for its performance capabilities. The 8GB RAM provides ample room for running multiple containers and allows for future scalability.

- **[4U Rack Cabinet](https://www.compumail.dk/en/p/lanberg-rack-gra-993865294)**: A 4U Rack to encapsulate all components cleanly. It provides the benefit of space efficiency and easy access for any hardware changes or additions.

- **[Rack Power Supply](https://www.compumail.dk/en/p/lanberg-pdu-09f-0300-bk-stromstodsbeskytter-9-stik-16a-sort-3m-996106700)**: A centralized power supply solution for the entire rack. Ensures consistent and reliable power distribution to all the components.

- **[GeeekPi 1U Rack Kit for Raspberry Pi 4B, 19" 1U Rack Mount](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B0972928CN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)**: This 19 inch rack mount kit is specially designed for recording Raspberry Pi 4B boards and supports up to 4 units.

- **[SanDisk Extreme microSDHC 3 Rescue Pro Deluxe Memory Card, Red/Gold 64GB](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B07FCMBLV6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)**: Up to 160MB/s Read speed and 60 MB/s. Write speed for fast recording and transferring

- **[Vanja SD/Micro SD Card Reader](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B00W02VHM6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)**: Micro USB OTG Adapter and USB 2.0 Memory Card Reader

- **[deleyCON 5 x 0.25 m CAT8.1](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B08WPJVGHR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)**: deleyCON CAT 8.1 patch cable network cable as set // 2x RJ45 plug // S/FTP PIMF shielding

### Why These Choices?

**Mobility**: The 4U Rack allows me to move the entire setup easily, making it convenient for different scenarios, from a home office to a small business environment.
  
**Professional-Grade Networking**: The Mikrotik router provides a rich feature set generally found in enterprise-grade hardware, offering me a sandbox to experiment with advanced networking configurations.
  
**Scalability**: The Raspberry Pi units and the Rack setup are easily scalable. I can effortlessly add more Pis to the cluster, enhancing its capabilities.

**Affordability**: This setup provides a balance between cost and performance, giving me a powerful Kubernetes cluster without breaking the bank.
